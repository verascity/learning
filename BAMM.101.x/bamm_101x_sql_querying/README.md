This folder contains a web scraper and SQL querying function written for the (audited) edX/ColumbiaX course BAMM.101x, Analytics in Python.

The instructions, database setup, and autograder code were provided by the course, as were the mock .htm and .txt files; the functions get_price() and get_pnl() are my solution to the challenge.
