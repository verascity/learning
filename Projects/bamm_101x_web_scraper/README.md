This folder contains a web scraper written for the edX/ColumbiaX course BAMM.101x, Analytics in Python. 

The instructions in cell 1 (of the IPython Notebook), file handler in cell 2, and autograder cells were provided by the course, as were the mock .htm files; the function in cell 3 of the Notebook (the function google_sector_report() in the Python file) is my solution to the challenge.
