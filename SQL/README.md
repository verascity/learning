### Relational Databases with SQL

This repository contains examples of some of the PostgreSQL-style code I learned while taking the Bertelsmann Udacity Data Science Scholarship. The queries in this repo were run through Udacity's SQL module, but I saved the queries in Visual Studio Code so I could look back on my work later on.
