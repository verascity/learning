### Exploring and Summarizing Data

This repository contains the R code and subsequent knit HTML/image files I created for the Nanodegree project "Explore and Summarize Data." For this project, we were tasked with choosing or finding a dataset and doing exploratory data analysis and visualization in R. 

I chose to use my own datasets: two files on adopted and foster children in New York City in 2015, sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/data4democracy/foster-care-nyc). Happily, I did not need to do much to clean the data, other than adjust column names and create factors out of invalid data types. I primarily used ggplot2 for my EDA and visualizations. Some of my findings greatly surprised me, though not others. I plan to revisit this and other foster/adoption data in the future for further analysis, especially on the disability/special needs front.
