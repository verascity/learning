# Exploring Weather Trends (With SQL and Python)

This repository contains my submission for "Exploring Weather Trends," the first project of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. The project brief was as follows:

>- Extract the data from the database. There's a workspace in the previous section that is connected to a database. You’ll need to export >the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where you live. You can find a list of cities and countries in >the city_list table.
>    - Write a SQL query to extract the city level data. Export to CSV.
>    - Write a SQL query to extract the global data. Export to CSV.
>- Open up the CSV in whatever tool you feel most comfortable using. We suggest using Excel or Google sheets, but you are welcome to use >another tool, such as Python or R.
>- Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather >than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable (the last concept in the previous lesson goes >over how to do this in a spreadsheet).
>- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends. 


#### Method: 
I live in New York City, so of course that was the city I chose to tackle. You can view the SQL queries I wrote in my final report, contained in this repository. I then used Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to visualize the extracted data and make observations. After running the analysis on New York, I decided to see if other cities would follow a similar pattern, so I repeated the process with a SQL query of five random cities. 

#### Outcome:
I learned some interesting (if largely unsurprising) things about temperature history. I learned more about how to integrate multiple technologies when doing data analysis.
