### Investigate a Dataset

This repository contains the code and my report for the third Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree project, "Investigate a Dataset." In this project, we were tasked with going through the complete data analysis process, from gathering to visualizing and reporting, on one of a list of curated datasets. This was my first attempt at using Python to create something that could be reused; the code runs on the dataset I used when __name__ == "__main__", but it also contains several helpful data analysis and visualization functions that can be imported for later use.
