### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

This repository contains code for four of the eight projects I completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) program, as well as two folders of code I wrote during the Bertelsmann Udacity Data Science Scholarship Challenge (BUDS), which ultimately won me a scholarship to the DAND. The remaining four projects will soon be hosted on my new website.
