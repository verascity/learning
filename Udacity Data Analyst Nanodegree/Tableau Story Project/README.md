### Tableau Story Project

This repository houses the Python code I wrote to handle the massive PISA2012 dataset (over 2.75 GB, unzipped) that Udacity provided for the 'Create a Tableau Story' final project. Using Pandas, I uploaded the data, used the accompanying data dictionary to generate understandable column names, selected a subset of columns, and assessed and cleaned for validity. I uploaded the resulting .csv to Tableau to handle the rest.

The most current version of the project, an interactive data story about the PISA 2012 results, can be found [here at Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/vera.sticker#!/vizhome/PISA2012ProjectFinalVersion/Story1). Ignore the fact that the link says "final" -- I have several upgrades planned!
