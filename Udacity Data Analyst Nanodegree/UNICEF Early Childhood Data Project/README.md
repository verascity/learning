### UN/UNICEF Data Project - for the BUDS Mini Challenge

While completing the Bertelsmann Udacity Data Science (BUDS) scholarship course that ultimately got me into the Data Analyst Nanodegree, I joined with several other students on a "mini project" challenge: to put together a little [data science magazine](https://medium.com/world-through-the-eyes-of-a-data-scientist) on Medium. 

This repository contains the Python code my team and I wrote over a shared Jupyter Notebook for our project, using an early childhood dataset from the UN/UNICEF data library. I was responsible for the analysis and write-up.
